# Screen manager shell scripts

Sharing these scripts - mainly for myself - with a hope to help some folks.

The idea is very basic, I have some extra keys on my keyboard and I wanted to use two of them to control the displays on my setup in a way to eliminate the need to open settings all the time. 

<h3>How it works</h3>
Run ``xrandr`` and observe the output. Mainly we are interested in the screen names and the relative position to each other. 
Setup the shell scripts and assign them into key(s, combination(s)) and enjoy.
